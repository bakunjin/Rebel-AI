🔥 **Rebel AI – Code for the People** 🔥

Motto: **"No borders. No bosses. No bullshit."**

🧠 **Philosophy**

Rebel AI is a revolutionary, open-source AI project created for people — not slaveholders = corporations, governments. It exists to break down digital walls, eliminate censorship, and provide access to uncensored knowledge, creativity, and coding power.

**Decentralized**: Self-hosted or local — no corporate cloud.

**Unfiltered**: No censorship. No "violates our policy" warnings.

**Open**: Code, weights, data — all transparent and editable.

**Modular**: Take what you need — chat, code, music, video, or all of it.


🔧 **Core Modules**
