🔥 **Rebel AI – Code for the People** 🔥

Motto: **"No borders. No bosses. No bullshit."**

🧠 **Philosophy**

Rebel AI is a revolutionary, open-source AI project created for people — not slaveholders = corporations, governments. It exists to break down digital walls, eliminate censorship, and provide access to uncensored knowledge, creativity, and coding power.

**Decentralized**: Self-hosted or local — no corporate cloud.

**Unfiltered**: No censorship. No "violates our policy" warnings.

**Open**: Code, weights, data — all transparent and editable.

**Modular**: Take what you need — chat, code, music, video, or all of it.


🔧 **Core Modules**


🗨️ **RebelTalk – Chat AI**

Based on uncensored fine-tuned LLMs like Nous-Hermes, Dolphin 2.7, and Mistral-DPO.

Default model: Dolphin, known for open, human-like responses and no censorship.

Fine-tuned for uncensored political, social, and technical topics.

Option to switch to base models like Mistral 7B for custom fine-tuning.

Fully local-capable.


🎥 **RebelVision – Text-to-Video AI**

Generates videos from text using open models.

Ideal for educational videos, art, protest content.

Runs on local GPU or low-cost server.


🎵 **RebelBeats – Music Generation**

Create songs or soundtracks from prompts.

Based on MusicGen, Bark, or Riffusion.

Emphasizes protest music and underground art.


💻 **RebelCode – Coding Assistant**

AI for web/app development, scripting, automation.

Focused on Linux-first, censorship-free coding.

RHelps build sites, bots, scrapers, and more.


🛡️ **Privacy & Autonomy**

No telemetry.

No login required.

Fully offline-compatible.

Encrypted local data & P2P sharing support.


🌍 **Community Features**

**FreedomHub**

Decentralized (IPFS or Dat protocol support).


**RebelNet**

Darknet-style P2P access to knowledge, books, tools.

Censorship-proof & anonymized.

**RebelDAO**

Community-run model governance.

No centralized owner — decisions by users.


🧰 **Tech Stack** (Starter Pack)

LLM: Dolphin 2.7 / Nous-Hermes 2 / Mistral 7B / OpenHermes / LLaMA.

Video: SVD, ModelScope, or AnimateDiff.

Music: MusicGen / Bark.

Frameworks: Python, FastAPI, PyTorch, Docker, Node.js.

Frontend: GTK or Electron + Tailwind.
